IoT Smart Waste Management Solution

Overview

This document outlines the high-level architecture, production setup, development process, and cost estimation for a smart waste management system leveraging IoT and a hybrid cloud design on Microsoft Azure.

Solution Architecture

High-Level Design

The system is based on a Microservices Architecture for ease of design, scalability, configurability, and management. The solution consists of the following components:

Microservices (Back Office):

User Management Service (UMS):

Azure MSSQL

Kubernetes Node

Azure Functions, Azure Service Bus, SMS Twilio, Azure Key Vault

Customer Management Service (CMS):

Azure MSSQL

Kubernetes Node

Azure Functions, Azure Service Bus, Mobile Notification

Device Management Service (DMS)

Asset-Fleet Management Service (AFMS):

Azure PostgreSQL Cluster, Azure Cosmos DB (Cassandra API)

Redis Cache, Azure Functions, Azure Time Series Insights

Supports GIS for GeoJSON

Telemetry-Alarm-Rules Management Service (TARMS)

Azure IoT Hub Management Service (AIoTMS)

API Gateway for Service Registration (APIG)

Microservices (Clients):

User Interface Service (UIS)

Customer Interface Service (CIS)

Remote Monitoring Service (RMS)

Power BI and Analytics (PBI)

These microservices operate in a stateless configuration, orchestrated centrally for load balancing and scaling as necessary.

Data Storage and Processing

The system manages telemetry data through a combination of hot and cold paths:

Telemetry Management System:

Cold Path: Azure Blob Storage

Hot Path: Azure Cosmos DB (Cassandra API)

Stream Processing: Azure IoT Hub, Azure Stream Analytics

Development Processing

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are configured with:

Environments: Staging and Testing

Hosts: Virtual Machines (VMs)

Tools: Azure Container Service, Jenkins in VMs
